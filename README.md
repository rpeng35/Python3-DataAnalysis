# Python3-DataAnalysis
CPSC103 Final Project

My first cpsc project ever!

This is a data analysis project which aims to analyze the number of songs released each year in the range 1990 to 2010.
We are giving a long list of songs (songs.csv) along with their title, artist, year, popularity, duration, and tempo.
The way we approached this task is by following systematic program design where we first plan and visualize what our program will produce, then move on to the building and testing of the program.

Please take a look at both ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook) for more info!
